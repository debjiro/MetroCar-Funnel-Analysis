Understand the customer funnel and identify areas for improvement and optimization
## Data: 
App downloads(downloads)  from the year 2021(23.6k)and download stream signups + rides through April  2022

## Key Takeaways
- 1. Although there is a healthy conversion rate across platforms there is room for improvement which could be achieved by offering incentives to users and drivers based on performance.
- 2. There's a notable drop-off between ride requests and driver acceptance, suggesting a need to recruit more trained drivers.
- 3. Our target demographics for the advert should be the 35-44 age group because they represent the working class and would commute often within the peak periods.
- 4. Implementing price surges within observed peak periods in the morning and evening would be an avenue to optimize profits.

## Future Analysis Ideas
- Predominantly used vehicle type in metro car and location of use
- Driver's age group and gender
- Which mobile network connects the most passengers to metro drivers
- Which advertising strategy is most effective in terms of accessing our target demographics
